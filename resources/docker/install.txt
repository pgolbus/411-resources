The first step is to run the official installer

> sh get-docker.sh

After that, you need to add your user to the docker "group". Otherwise you
will have to run docker as ROOT. We'll discuss all of this later.
Long story short, after running the installer, run

> sudo groupadd docker
> sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
> newgrp docker

Now you should be able to run

> docker run hello-world
