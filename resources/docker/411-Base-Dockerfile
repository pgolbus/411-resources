# Note that this base Dockerfile is meant as a barebonnes starting point
# Modify it to your hearts content

#########################
# Step 1: build the image

# # the -f flag specifies the Dockerfile. The . specifies the current working
# # directory as the build context

# docker build -t 411-base-image:1.0.0 -f 411-Base-Dockerfile .

# Step 2: create a directory for persistant local storage
# # You are going to want to be able to write data to your hard drive that
# # "persists" outside of the container. The first step is to create a
# # directory that is "mounted" inside of the container. What does "mounted"
# # mean?
# # # https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mount-command-in-linux-with-examples/

# mkdir container_storage

#########################
# Step 3: run the container with persistent storage.
# # Running the container both creates it and starts it
# # The -it flags start it in interactive terminal mode
# # -v attaches the volume
# # -p maps the https port (443) from the host into the container

# docker run -it \
#            -v </path/to/container_storage>/container_storage:/usr/src/app \
#            -p 443:443 \
#            --name my-411-container \
#            411-base-image:1.0.0

# # note that you MUST specify a path to container_storage. If it is in the same directory as where you are
# # running docker it's at .

# docker run -it \
#            -v ./container_storage:/usr/src/app \
#            -p 443:443 \
#            --name my-411-container \
#            411-base-image:1.0.0

#########################
# Step 4: exit the container

# exit

# # or

# ctrl-d

########################
# Step 5: stop the container

# docker stop my-411-container

#######################
# Step 6: restart the container
# # The -i flag starts it in interactive mode. It already has the terminal, storage and ports
# # from whan you ran it

# docker start -i my-411-container
