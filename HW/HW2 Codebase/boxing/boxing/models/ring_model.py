"""
Module for simulating boxing matches in a ring.

This module defines the RingModel class, which allows for adding boxers to the ring,
conducting a fight between two boxers, and computing the fight outcome based on their
calculated fighting skills. The module leverages logging for tracing execution, uses a
random number generator to simulate fight uncertainty, and updates boxer statistics
accordingly.
