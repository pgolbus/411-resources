(It saddens me to say that this was a joke written by ChatGPT for 131)
You have just been hired as employee number n for some small number n. 
They have the dev chops to make a demo, but you are their first serious developer. 
Here is a theme and an epic: 

Theme: Get GiggleGit demo into a stable enough alpha to start onboarding some adventurous clients
Epic: Onboarding experience 

Complete these user stories:

As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to quickly get
used to merging with memes, so that I can merge my edits.

Task: Write/improve existing documentation on GiggleGit for new and learning users

Ticket 1: Write detailed guide on GiggleGit merging; Provide tutorial that explains
managing merges with memes based on git instructions.

Ticket 2: Provide tutorial videos to show conversion between git to GiggleGit to help
users adapt; Provide videos with timestamps and chapters to allow viewers to understand actions in GiggleGit

As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to ensure my team's understanding
of complex merge conflicts using memes, so that issues can be resolved efficiently and the project
can continue.

Task: Create advanced documentation and training manual for merge conflict situations with GiggleGit

Ticket 1: Write more advanced guide on GiggleGit merge conflicts; Write a document to provide
step-by-step instructions for common merge conflict scenarios, as well as edge cases including multiple
branches.

Ticket 2: Build interactive demo/scenario tool for merge conflict; Develop interactive tutorial using
the GiggleGit system that takes experienced users through real-world simulated scenarios, allowing
users to practice choosing memes to resolve conflicts.

As a systems administrator that oversees teams of GiggleGit users, I also want to know how to deal with
merge conflicts extensively well, in order to resolve conflicts when working with larger groups for projects.

Task 1: Create a system to efficiently resolve merge conflicts

Ticket 1: Set up centralized merge conflict management system; Set up a centralized system that tracks and
manages merge conflicts for GiggleGit teams. The system should provide administrators access to intervene with
merge conflicts across all related repositories.

Ticket 2: Implement Team-Based Merge Conflict Workflow; Design a workflow that is optimized for team based 
projects. This should include functions such as flagging conflicts, suggesting methods of resolution, and
assigning conflicts to users or entire teams.


This is not a user story. Why not? What is it?

"As a user I want to be able to authenticate on a new machine "

The statement is not a full user story because it does not express the user's goal. We do not know
what the user intends to gain out of the authentication on the new machine.
