1. Complete these user stories:
* As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to…
understand what GiggleGit provides in respect to vanilla git and learn to use it efficiently. 

* As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to…
quickly onboard my team and provide details on advanced GiggleGit features that will be used. 

2. Create a third user story, one task for this user story, and two associated tickets.
As a new  user that has never used GiggleGit nor vanilla Git, I want to easily navigate through the important documentations to get started. 

* task: increase accessibility and decrease complexity of navigation 

* ticket 1: Implement in-page hyperlinks in documentation
add links on important keywords that will take the user to relevant information  

* ticket 2: prominant "getting started" section in the homepage
add a clearly visible and easily accessible "Getting Started" section on the homepage that directs new users to the documentation for setting up and using GiggleGit.


3. This is not a user story. Why not? What is it?
this is not a user story because the story is extremely vague: it doesn't tell me what kind of user it is, and doesn't give me an idea of why they want to able to authenticate on a new machine. 

this is more of a request for a feature/benefit.
