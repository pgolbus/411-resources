User Story 1: Vanilla Git Power-User
As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to quickly understand how merging works using memes, so that I can use it without disrupting my existing workflow.

Task: Improve Documentation for Git Power-Users

Ticket 1: Add Git-specific onboarding guide
Description: Write an onboarding guide that explains GiggleGit’s meme-based merging in terms familiar to experienced Git users.

Ticket 2: Provide a side-by-side Git vs. GiggleGit video tutorial
Description: Create a tutorial that shows common merge scenarios in Git vs. GiggleGit to help power-users transition.


User Story 2: Team Lead Onboarding an Experienced GiggleGit User
As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want a way to review past merge decisions, so that I can ensure my team is using consistent workflows.

Task: Build Merge History Review Feature

Ticket 1: Implement a "merge history" UI panel
Description: Add a feature that allows team leads to review previous merges, including associated memes and decision logs.

Ticket 2: Enable merge decision commenting
Description: Allow team leads to leave comments on past merges to guide best practices within the team.


User Story 3: New Developer Exploring GiggleGit
As a new developer joining a team that uses GiggleGit, I want an interactive demo environment, so that I can safely practice merges without affecting real projects.

Task: Create an Interactive Sandbox Mode

Ticket 1: Develop a non-destructive "Sandbox Mode"
Description: Build an isolated environment where new users can experiment with GiggleGit’s meme-based merging without affecting repositories.

Ticket 2: Add guided challenges for new users
Description: Implement a series of hands-on tutorials in Sandbox Mode that teach key GiggleGit features through interactive exercises.


Question: "As a user, I want to be able to authenticate on a new machine"

Why is this not a user story?
It lacks a clear goal or reason, like it doesn’t really explain WHY the user wants to authenticate.
It's objectiely way too vague. Auth is a broad concept and could mean many different things.
